# Getting Started
This is the implementation(modified) of this paper https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12195/12023. This is a siamese architecture which uses Manhattan distance to calculate the similarity of outputs. It then backpropogates based on the distance.This is a simple architecture with one LSTM hidden layer.I have used this in Quora question pairs challenge and implementation can be found here https://github.com/avinashsai/Quora-Question-Pairs/tree/master/Models/MaLSTM.

# Things to implement:
1. Intialize forget gate bias to large value.

2. Use pre trained weights on SemEval dataset.
